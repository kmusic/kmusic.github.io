Oopsie Machine Walkthrough

Burpsuite Proxy can be used to intercept web traffic.

First I ran nmap -sV on this machine and found the following:

nmap -sV 10.129.164.213
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-04 19:06 UTC
Nmap scan report for 10.129.164.213
Host is up (0.0024s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.64 seconds

From this scan, we can tell that ports 22 and 80 are open.

Next, remember to plug in the IP address and see what the webpage looks like!!!

We will then see that there is an option to Log In to see additional services. Running BurpSuite we find a link http://10.129.164.213/cdn-cgi/login/
