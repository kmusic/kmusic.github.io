Oopsie Machine Walkthrough

Burpsuite Proxy can be used to intercept web traffic.

First I ran nmap -sV on this machine and found the following:

nmap -sV 10.129.164.213
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-04 19:06 UTC

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.64 seconds

From this scan, we can tell that ports 22 and 80 are open.

Next, remember to plug in the IP address and see what the webpage looks like!!!
